## ‚öôÔ∏è Scheduled Tasks

The installer creates two scheduled tasks:

1. **SharePoint Security Monitor**
   - Runs every hour
   - Performs full security scan
   - Sends alerts if threats detected

2. **SharePoint Daily Security Report**
   - Runs daily at 8:00 AM
   - Sends comprehensive summary
   - Includes all events from past 24 hours

## üîç Detection Patterns

### CVE-2025-53770 Specific
- Upload exploit attempts in IIS logs
- Malformed ASPX requests
- ViewState manipulation attempts
- Path traversal patterns

### Webshell Signatures
- Code evaluation functions
- Base64 encoding/decoding
- Process execution methods
- Network operations
- File system manipulation
- Known webshell names

### Suspicious Processes
- nc, ncat, netcat
- mimikatz
- procdump
- psexec
- wmic
- certutil
- bitsadmin

## üìß Email Alerts

### Alert Triggers
- Any webshell detection
- Failed logins > 5 per hour
- New ASPX/ASMX files created
- File modifications detected
- Suspicious processes running
- CVE exploit attempts

### Email Format
- HTML formatted with responsive design
- Color-coded status indicators
- Detailed tables for findings
- Direct links to affected resources
- Timestamp and server information

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Test email configuration:
   ```powershell
   .\Test-Email.ps1
   ```
2. Check SMTP server connectivity
3. Verify sender address is authorized
4. Check spam filters

### Performance Issues
- Reduce scan frequency in scheduled task
- Limit paths in webshell detection
- Adjust log retention period

### False Positives
- Review and update baseline
- Adjust detection thresholds in script
- Add exclusions for known safe files

## üîê Security Considerations

- Run with minimum required privileges
- Secure the installation directory
- Regularly review and update baselines
- Monitor the monitoring system logs
- Keep detection patterns updated

## üìù Configuration Options

Edit `SharePoint-Monitor.ps1` to customize:

```powershell
# Thresholds
$FailedLoginThreshold = 5    # Trigger alert after X failed logins

# Paths to monitor
$WebPaths = @(
    "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories",
    "C:\custom\path"
)

# Known malicious IPs
$KnownBadIPs = @(
    "192.168.1.100",
    "10.0.0.50"
)
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

### Adding Detection Patterns

To add new webshell signatures:
```powershell
$WebshellSignatures = @{
    "your_pattern_regex" = "Pattern Description"
}
```
