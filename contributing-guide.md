## Adding New Detection Patterns

### Webshell Signatures

To add a new webshell signature:

1. Edit `SharePoint-Monitor.ps1`
2. Find the `$WebshellSignatures` hashtable
3. Add your pattern:

```powershell
$WebshellSignatures = @{
    # ... existing patterns ...
    "your_regex_pattern" = "Description of what this detects"
}
```

### CVE Detection Patterns

For new CVE-specific patterns:

1. Add to the `$ExploitPatterns` array
2. Document the CVE number and description
3. Include example log entries if possible

### Testing Your Patterns

1. Create a test file with the malicious pattern
2. Run the monitor in test mode
3. Verify detection and no false positives
4. Clean up test files

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sharepoint-security-monitor.git
cd sharepoint-security-monitor
```

2. Create a test environment
```powershell
# Create test directory structure
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\TestSharePoint" -Force
```

3. Run tests
```powershell
# Run with test configuration
.\Install-SharePointSecurityMonitor.ps1 -InstallPath "C:\TestSharePoint" -SkipEmailTest
```

## Style Guide

### PowerShell Style

* Use PascalCase for function names
* Use camelCase for variable names
* Always include comment-based help for functions
* Use proper indentation (4 spaces)
* Include error handling with try/catch blocks

Example:
```powershell
function Get-SecurityStatus {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Gets the current security status
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        Detailed description here
    
    .PARAMETER ComputerName
        The computer to check
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-SecurityStatus -ComputerName "SERVER01"
    #>
    param(
        [string]$ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
    )
    
    try {
        # Your code here
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to get security status: $_"
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
